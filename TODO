"Still quite a bit todo for LibTomFloat."

Yes, Tom, that's right.

Besides the obligatory check for correctness, which is always number zero
in every TODO list, the following points are the more acute ones.

1. Rounding is incomplete. It needs the implementation of 4 (four) guard bits
   to do the following rounding modes from the C-standard (or more if time
   allows)
   a. FE_TONEAREST  Round to nearest.
   b. FE_UPWARD     Round toward +infinity
   c. FE_DOWNWARD   Round toward -infinity
   d. FE_TOWARDZERO Round toward zero.

2. The code for printing strings is an unholy mess.
   a. The whole thing is an unholy mess.

3. The domain for the Lambert-W function is restricted to the magnitude of a
   64-bit double. Expanding it is a lot of work.
   a. check all the rest, it might not be the only one with a domain
      restriction.

4. Some of the functions from Posix need implementation. See documentation in
   the file float_new.tex or float_new.pdf respectively and look for empty
   sections. Most of them are just needful things, the others are the special
   functions: the Error and Bessel functions.
   a. Gamma function is implemented with Spouge's algorithm which is a bit
      slow but simple. Check if using Stirling's series directly is faster
      with real input.
   b. Implement other useful functions?

5. Not everything is thread- and/or async-safe but it needs to be (thread-safe
   at least)!

6. Complex numbers?

7. Some of the functions depend on functions in LibTomMath that are not in the
   official version (yet?). These need to get out if possible.

Points taken from the old TODO (enumeration is from the old TODO, too):

4.  More things to the manual.  I plan on doing this with every release cycle though.

5.  MSVC makefile
