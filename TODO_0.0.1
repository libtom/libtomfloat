Still quite a bit todo for LibTomFloat.

1. The following functions [as of v0.01] have not been implemented (the .C files are present but not populated)

   - mpf_acos
   - mpf_asin
   - mpf_atan
   - mpf_const_1pi    [*]
   - mpf_const_2pi    [*]
   - mpf_const_2rpi   [*]
   - mpf_const_l10e   [*]
   - mpf_const_l2e    [*]
   - mpf_const_le2    [*]
   - mpf_const_pi     [*]
   - mpf_const_pi2    [*]
   - mpf_const_pi4    [*]
   - mpf_ln
   - mpf_pow          [*]
   - Any form of string input/output 

[*] Denotes functions which are written but depend upon incomplete functions to work.

The critical path lies in two functions.  The first is mpf_ln from which I can write mpf_pow and the various constants will function.  
The second is mpf_atan from which I can write mpf_const_pi and finish off the missing constants.

From there it's a matter of adding mpf_asin, mpf_acos and mpf_tan and I have a decent subset of math in there.

2.  Once all of the functions have been written I want to add early-out optimizations to the various series calculations.  Right now
they use an arbitrary high count and get accurate results.  However, quite a few functions stabalize quickly and do not need so many
iterations.  In particular I plan to start on mpf_invsqrt() as it forms the basis of mpf_inv() which is used in mpf_cos() [and other trigs].

    At the same time I want to add more domain checking (e.g. valid inputs).  

3.  Add decent string input/output

4.  More things to the manual.  I plan on doing this with every release cycle though.

5.  MSVC makefile
